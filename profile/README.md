# Welcome to the moclojer cloud team ðŸ™Œ

![moclojer](https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer/raw/main/docs/assets/logo.png)

The main goal of **moclojer cloud** with **product focus** and **Clojure by design**, providing shared _mock server hosting_ (using moclojer open source), operates **fully distributed**.

We will be a startup _(we are not yet, we are a parallel project that the founders are investing their own equity in)_ that follows the [open startup model](https://hackernoon.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-open-startup-f4446984189) (everything related to money will be open, from employees' salaries to billing, [see this example](https://cal.com/open)). This might drive away some people who don't want to have their **"financial life" public**.

> We are not looking to make a lot of money but to finance a small team to develop moclojer and in the future other open source products and libraries for the clojure world.

_We use as inspiration what [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet) has done for the Golang ecosystem._
