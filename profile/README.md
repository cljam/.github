# Welcome to the **cljazz** team ðŸ™Œ

![cljazz](https://github.com/organizations/cljazz/settings/profile)

The main goal of **cljazz** with **product focus** and **Clojure by design**, We develop open source projects written in Clojure and create a _hosted version_ of it so you (or your company) don't have to worry about infrastructure - [Micro SaaS](https://engsoftmoderna.info/artigos/micro-saas.html).

We will be a startup _(we are not yet, we are a parallel project that the founders are investing their own equity in)_ that follows the [open startup model](https://hackernoon.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-open-startup-f4446984189) (everything related to money will be open, from employees' salaries to billing, [see this example](https://cal.com/open)). This might drive away some people who don't want to have their **"financial life" public**, we understand if our open financial model bothers you, **but that's who we are!**

> We are not looking to make a lot of money but to finance a small team to develop moclojer and in the future other open source products and libraries for the clojure world.

_We use as inspiration what [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet) has done for the Golang ecosystem._
